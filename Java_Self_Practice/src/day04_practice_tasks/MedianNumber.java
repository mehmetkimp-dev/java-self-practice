/*
MedianNumber Task: Create a class named MedianNumber. Write a program that finds the median number between
three DIFFERENT given integers (Assume that the given three integers are distinct numbers).

			Example:
				   a = 10;
				   b = 15;
				   c = 20;

			Output:
				  15 is the median number
