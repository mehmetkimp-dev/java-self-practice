/*
CrewAndPassenger Task: Create a class called CrewAndPassenger. Given the total number of people on the ship,
	determine how many should be crew members and how many can be passengers.

		Total: 50 ====> 20 crew, 30 passengers
		Total: 75 ====> 25 crew, 50 passengers
		Total: 100 ====> 30 crew, 70 passengers
		Any other number of people on the ship is not valid.
		Print how many of each type there should be.

			Example:
				   number = 75

			Output:
				  25 crew, 50 passengers
